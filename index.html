        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>CSS is used to style the information on a website</li>
        <li>This can be done using inline CSS, internal or external style sheets</li>  
        <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are quick to use within the HTML code</li>
        <li>The downside of these is that you have to repeat the code for each instance</li>
        <li>External style sheets are better used for repeated commands, such as how all headers should be formatted</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>  
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A selection of data within a container is called an array.</li>
          <li>Data within an array is numbered sequentially, starting from 0</li>
          <li>Common practice is to write x+1 as x++</li>
          <li>Functions can be used to tell the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>It is not enough to simply define a function - it must be 'called' to be executed.</li>
          <li>A function is called at the end of a script</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
