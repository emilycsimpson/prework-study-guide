 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- As a bootcamp student, I wanted to consolidate the knowledge I had gained.
- I also wanted to try out the different kinds of code I had learned through the pre-work.
- The Prework Study Guide is a way of organising the notes I have taken on paper, and makes it easier to search for what I need.
